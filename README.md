# Projectile_Motion_w-drag
The algorithm and simulation (plot, table) of finding an optimal angle in a projectile motion with drag taken into account.
Context: There were many open-source projects on finding the distance of a projectile motion launched at a certain angle with or without drag. However, in the Robogrinder Club at VT, we had to figure out the shooting angle instead so that the bullets can hit other robots as expected. Therefore, an algorithm based off of binary search was designed, and the simulation was conducted to test the functionality.
